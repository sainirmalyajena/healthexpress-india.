# Why is Surgery More Affordable in India?

India has gained international recognition for providing world-class medical treatments at a fraction of the cost found in Western countries. This affordability does not come at the expense of quality.

## Quality of Care
Top hospitals in India are often JCI (Joint Commission International) or NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) accredited. Many Indian surgeons have extensive experience, having trained or worked in the UK, USA, or Europe.

## Factors Influencing the Cost
Several variables determine the final bill for a surgical procedure in India:

### 1. Choice of City
Metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore may have higher overheads compared to Tier-2 cities. However, they also house some of the most advanced medical facilities.

### 2. Type of Hospital
- **Super-specialty Corporate Hospitals**: Offer the latest technology and premium amenities but at a higher price point.
- **Trust-run Hospitals**: Often more affordable while still maintaining high standards of clinical care.

### 3. Procedure Complexity
Laparoscopic (minimally invasive) procedures may have a higher initial cost due to equipment but often result in shorter hospital stays, potentially lowering the overall expense.

### 4. Room Category
Costs vary significantly between general wards, semi-private rooms, and private suites.

## Insurance and Cashless Treatment
HealthExpress India works closely with hospitals that offer cashless facilities for major insurance providers.
