# Recovering from Hernia Surgery

A hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective tissue. Hernia surgery is a common procedure, but recovery is crucial for long-term success.

## The First 24-48 Hours
Immediately following surgery, you may feel groggy from anesthesia. Pain management is the priority. Most patients can go home the same day.

- **Pain Control**: Follow your surgeon's instructions for prescribed medication.
- **Incision Care**: Keep the surgical area clean and dry.
- **Mobility**: Light walking around the house is encouraged to prevent blood clots.

## Week 1: Taking It Easy
During the first week, focus on rest while slowly increasing your activity level.

### Activity Restrictions
- Do not lift anything heavier than 5kg.
- Avoid strenuous exercise or heavy household chores.
- Walking is the best form of exercise during this phase.

### Diet and Nutrition
Constipation is a common side effect of pain medication and reduced activity.
- Drink plenty of water.
- Eat high-fiber foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.

## Weeks 2-4: Gradual Progress
As you enter the second and third weeks, you will start feeling much better.

- **Returning to Work**: Most patients with desk jobs can return within 1-2 weeks. If your job involves manual labor, you may need 4-6 weeks.
- **Driving**: You can usually drive once you are off narcotic pain medications and can comfortably make an emergency stop.

## When to Call Your Doctor
Contact your surgical team if you experience:
- Fever above 101°F (38.3°C).
- Increasing redness or swelling around the incision.
- Drainage or bleeding from the incision.
- Severe pain not controlled by medication.
- Difficulty urinating.
